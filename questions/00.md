# Sinatra: Application Structure

If we want to set up our app to return associated data in our JSON using Active Record, which of the following steps are \*\*required\*\* (select all that apply):

## Correct

Set up the association in our Model file.

> Yes!
> 
> We always need to set up the association in our Model file, because the model is
> what is responsible for setting up and updating the code in our database.

## Incorrect

Specify the association we want to include by using the `to_json` method's
include option.

> Not quite!
> 
> While using the `to_json` include option is going to be helpful down the line,
> it isn't \*\*required\*\* to get our associated data.

## Incorrect

Use the `only` option to specify which attributes we want to include.

> Not quite!
> 
> While using the `only` include option is going to be helpful down the line in
> terms of specificity, it isn't \*\*required\*\* to get access to our associated
> data.

## Incorrect

Create a separate request for the associated data in our frontend.

> Try again!
> 
> We definitely want to make the connection to our frontend so our users can see
> our data, however it isn't required to actually access the associated data.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
