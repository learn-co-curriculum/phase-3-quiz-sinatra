# Sinatra: Requests

We're setting up a route to allow a user to create a new recipe. Given the
following route code:

```rb
______ "/recipes" do
  recipe = Recipe.create(
    name: params[:name],
    ingredients: params[:ingredients]
  )
  recipe.to\_json
end
```

What goes in the blank?

## Correct

post

> Nailed it! We are creating an instance of a recipe, so we need to set up a
> route to handle POST requests to "/recipes".
